Hi Developer,

So assume that we have our navigation stored in the DB, 
for this test we are going to assume that `fetchData` function inside 
navData.js is the source of navConfigs for us.

You need to build a Dynamic Navigation Builder, 
which takes this navConfig.
and renders a navigation tree, to as many levels as the config provided.

You can assume that data sent out from config will be in the 
same format of
-------
id, 
name,
& children
-------
as you can see in the navData.js


Q1. You can see the accepted result in PageTree.png, 
that's how it should render on the UI.

Q2. Initially, those arrow keys are not functional, 
but if you can make it show/hide the chidren subTree of navigation,
that would be a big plus.
